CoreJS. Part 5
1. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript code execution and provide an example for each.
2. Write JavaScript code that uses the setTimeout function to log a message after a specified delay, and then clear the timeout using clearTimeout.
3. Write JavaScript code that uses the setInterval function to repeatedly log a message at a specified interval, and then clear the interval using clearInterval.
4. Write JavaScript code that demonstrates the basic syntax of ES6 Promises by creating a simple promise that resolves with a value and handles the fulfillment and rejection cases.
5. Write JavaScript code that demonstrates the usage of the `async` and `await` keywords to handle asynchronous operations in a synchronous-looking manner.

6. Create a custom Error class called ValidationError that extends the built-in Error class. Use this class to throw an error called ValidationError with a custom error message when input validation fails.
